Welcome to [machinateur.dev](https://machinateur.dev/), my development blog and homepage.

I write about pretty much anything I've found to be poorly documented online regarding php and other web technologies.
While I try to focus on the topics and stuff I wish I would've known earlier or that were hard to gain knowledge about.
There is no shortage of bug-anecdotes and reports too.

If you'd like to know more about me and my qualification, have a look at the ["About me" page](/about-me).
