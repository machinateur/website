Hello there!

My name is **Marcel** and I'm a software developer. You might have seen me around as **machinateur** (but likely you've
not).

This website ([machinateur.dev](https://machinateur.dev/)) is my development blog and homepage, but mainly it's a blog.
I've tried to make it the best possible experience - check out the controls in the navbar. In the process I added what
I've missed in other good websites and blogs and left out all the complicated shenanigans that nobody needs.

Eventually there will be many blog posts, but it takes time to write them; I've got a whole list to choose from, stay
tuned. A newsletter you ask? No there is no newsletter here. Drop me into your bookmarks and come visit now and then,
you could find something interesting.

Located near *Frankfurt, HE, Germany*, I'm currently working full-time, 40h a week. Another large chunk of my time goes
towards the private (and some day hopefully public and open-sourced) projects. I don't want to put something out that
isn't ready, so that's that.

I've started out in 2011 doing java for a couple of years, then got into php again in 2016. And I've been writing php
ever since. There are a bunch of unfinished java projects still lurking in the depths of my old hard-drives, helplessly
hoping to get paid a visit some distant day (I've promised).

Most of my open-source work has been done under another alias, so it's still kind of empty over at
[my github profile](https://github.com/machinateur).

A little fun-fact or side-note, if you will, on how I initially found out about programming, long story short:
click [this link](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_Beta_1.8.1). `:D`

My repertoire of programming languages spans from [PHP](https://www.php.net) throughout the frontend stuff (_HTML_,
_CSS_, _JavaScript_), to [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/) (little dusty). Different SQL dialects
(_MariaDB_, _MySQL_, _Oracle/PLSQL_) too. [Python](https://www.python.org) is somewhat new to the list, but I consider
myself still learning it.

Currently, my favourite technologies and projects to work with are [Symfony](https://symfony.com),
[Twig](https://twig.symfony.com), [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org),
[JMS Serializer](https://jmsyst.com/libs/serializer), [Slim Framework](https://www.slimframework.com). I could just go
on with the list, but these are the most significant ones. Containerization with
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/use-cases) is really interesting, and I'd like to use it more in the future.

I've just recently started getting into electronics too, involving [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/),
[Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) and [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/en/products/socs/esp32) and of course the usual
stuff like circuit design, soldering, etc.

Feel free to contact me via [hello \[at\] machinateur \[dot\] dev](mailto:).

Think that's it for now. I'll edit this page from time to time.
